## ⭐ Star Rating Component

This is a simple React component that displays a customizable star rating system using react-icons.

-   You can change the number of stars (numOfStars) via props.
-   Stars highlight on hover and stay selected when clicked.
-   Hovering and clicking update internal state (hover and rating).
-   Styling is controlled with CSS classes for active/inactive colors.

**Hooks used:**
`useState` – to track the selected rating and hovered star.

**Why I built it:**
To practice working with `useState`, event handlers, props, and conditional rendering in React — and to get familiar with using icon libraries like `react-icons`.
